# Team-Thrive
CSE 403
Winter 2023

Project Goal:
Thrive will be a web application that promotes productivity by allowing users to enter tasks that will be sorted based on priority and difficulty. Each task will be given a certain number of points based on difficulty, and users will be rewarded with those points once they complete the task. There is a fixed number of points a user can earn per day. Four major features we plan on implementing are a login page, a calendar where users can see which tasks they have due on which days, a reward system where users can redeem points for certain rewards, and lastly, a community page where users can post their progress, like and comment on posts, and support one another on their journeys towards better productivity. Two of our stretch goals are to create a mobile application and to generate recommendations for tasks.

The layout of this REPO will be:
