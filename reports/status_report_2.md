# 01/25 status report 2

## Section 1
The git assignment was mostly complete in our last update, so we wrapped that up quickly and began working on the basics of our app. For the frontend, this included creating a Figma wireframe to get an idea of what our frontend application will look like, including what pages we will have and their general layout. For the backend, we began working on user creation and outlining what kind of data needs to be stored for each user. 

Goals for this week for frontend is start implementing basic functionality within react. For backend we will try to have the database setup plus creating schemas and documentation for everything within the database. Also, we will be working on the architecture and design of our project.
