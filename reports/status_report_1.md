## Section 1
No status update from our TA since its early into our project.
Our Team agenda is to have 7 day sprints with two standups on Tuesday and Thursdays. This will allow us to have project meetings twice a week and a chance for everyone to give their updates and ask for help with any blockers. Goals for this week are using Figma to create a UI design for the frontend, and backend will research about firebase and start the process of setting the DB up.
