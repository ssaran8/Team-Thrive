## Section 1
This past week, we finalized the frontend design on Figma and worked a lot on the software architecture/design of our system. We're still looking into what the best way to go about continuous integration and plan to discuss that in our Thursday meeting.

For next week, the goal is to have the frontend team make major progress on converting the Figma prototype into React code, and the backend team plans to make major progress on implementing the backend code and wrtiting tests.
